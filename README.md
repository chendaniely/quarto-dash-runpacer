# Running paces and total times

## Setup

Take a look at the `setup` target from the `Makefile`

## Running + Deploying

Running: `make preview` or `make shiny`

Deploying: `make deploy_setup` will assume Posit Connect.
  `make deploy` will assume you already have a `$CONNECT_API_KEY` environment variable.
